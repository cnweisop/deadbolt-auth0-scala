    <h2>Deadbolt and Auth0</h2>

    <p>
        This starter application demonstrates how to use <a href="https://github.com/schaloner/deadbolt-2">Deadbolt</a> to provide authorization and drive
        authentication triggers. The identity management platform <a href="https://auth0.com">Auth0</a> is used to provide authentication support.
    </p>

    <p>
        This example was written as part of the <a href="https://leanpub.com/deadbolt-2">Deadbolt user guide</a>.

    <h2>AuthSupport</h2>

    <p>The bulk of the security mechanism can be found in AuthSupport. This manages the retrieval of the subject from the request, the cache or Auth0 in that
        order, as well as various other functionality. This class can essentially remain unchanged in most applications, unless some form of local user storage
        such as a database is also used.</p>

<div>
    <h2>AuthController</h2>

    <p>The entrypoint for a callback from Auth0. Once a user has authenticated on the identity management platform, the application is notified and provided
        with an authentication code for further interactions.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>MyDeadboltHandler</h2>

    <p>This drives the authentication behaviour based on the requirements of the application's authorizations. If (for example) a subject is not required to
        access a resource and no subject is present, access will be granted; if (also for example) a subject is required to access a resource but is not
        present, an unauthorised response (with the login page as content) will be sent back. In cases where a subject must hold certain roles or permissions to
        access a resource and they do not meet the requirements, the client will receive a forbidden response.</p>

<div>
    <h2>login.scala.html</h2>

    <p>A very simple page containing the script provided by Auth0 to generate a log-in dialog.</p>
